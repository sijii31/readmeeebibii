    <h2>To My Bibi Ko</h2>
    <p>Look, I'm really sorry for earlier, for not listening to you, for countering your rants. I was just trying to make you happy. I didnâ€™t realize I was making you more sad and starting to ruin your day. You know I never meant to hurt you, but itâ€™s still my fault.</p>
    <p>Please donâ€™t think that I donâ€™t understand you. I know you expected me to, and I do. I just thought maybe trying to joke would help lighten your mood. But I see now that you were serious, and I ended up making things worse.</p>
    <p>Love, I donâ€™t know what was happening to me earlier. All I did was cry nonstop. My heart was hurting so much. When I saw you keep walking while I sat down to rest, my hands and legs started shaking. The way you looked at me, when you didnâ€™t want to share my umbrella, when you didnâ€™t want to talk to me, everything just broke me. All I could do was cry and cry again. Even in the tricycle, I was still crying.</p>
    <p>It felt like, at any moment, you were going to leave me. Thatâ€™s why I kept trying to convince you, maybe we could just sit for a bit, or play in the arcade, even for a short while. But nothing worked.</p>
    <p>Can you please just tell me what you hate about me? Please?</p>
    <p>You know Iâ€™m willing to change for you, right? So donâ€™t hesitate to say whatever is in your heart, Iâ€™ll understand. And again, Iâ€™m really, really sorry.</p>
    <p>Can you give me another chance to prove myself to you? Can we start again?</p>
    <p>If youâ€™re willing, please, donâ€™t leave me, no matter what happens. I promise Iâ€™ll do anything you ask. Iâ€™ll become the version of myself you need, the one you deserve.</p>
    <p>I love you so much.</p>
