      Look, I'm really sorry for earlier, for not listening to you, for countering your rants. I was just trying to make you happy. I didn’t realize I was making you more sad and starting to ruin your day. You know I never meant to hurt you, but it’s still my fault.

<p> Please don’t think that I don’t understand you. I know you expected me to, and I do. I just thought maybe trying to joke would help lighten your mood. But I see now that you were serious, and I ended up making things worse. </p>

<p>Love, I don’t know what was happening to me earlier. All I did was cry nonstop. My heart was hurting so much. When I saw you keep walking while I sat down to rest, my hands and legs started shaking. The way you looked at me… when you didn’t want to share my umbrella, when you didn’t want to talk to me, everything just broke me. All I could do was cry and cry again. Even in the tricycle, I was still crying. </p>

<p>It felt like, at any moment, you were going to leave me. That’s why I kept trying to convince you, maybe we could just sit for a bit, or play in the arcade… even for a short while. But nothing worked.</p>

<p>Can you please just tell me what you hate about me? Please?
You know I’m willing to change for you, right? So don’t hesitate to say whatever is in your heart, I’ll understand. And again, I’m really, really sorry.
Can you give me another chance to prove myself to you? Can we start again?
If you’re willing… please, don’t leave me no matter what happens. I promise I’ll do anything you ask. I’ll become the version of myself you need the one you deserve.</p>
<p>I love you so much.</p>
